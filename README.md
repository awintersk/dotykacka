### Asynchronous communication

Odoo communicate dotykacka asynchronously. This means that Odoo does not wait for Dotykacka to confirm the receipt of the data. This is done to avoid delays in the POS. If the communication fails, the data is stored in the database and sent again later.
It is also used in returns/refunds - if cancel is done in dotykacka, it is automatically sent back to odoo and paired with/created relevant order.

For asynchronous communication db_name must be set, also parameter web.base.url must be the same as configured in dotykacka.

### Return/Claims

Creation of returns and claims are not supported by dotykacka API and has to be done manually in dotykacka. It is synchronized back to odoo using webhooks and new order is created in odoo.
